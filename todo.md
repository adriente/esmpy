# TODOs

* Check that the doc is somehow understandable and sufficiently complete
* Continue the tests
* Rename the estimators, make a separate estimator that accepts a ground truth to clean. Make a legacy.py for unused parts of updates.py

## EDXS modelling

* Better model detector response : add asymmetric gaussian peaks + shelf.
* Change the linear change in detector fwhm to the physical one.
